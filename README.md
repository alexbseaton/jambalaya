# jambalaya

## Current Goal
Graph price movements of several flights using the data we've gathered so far. Compare them on the same axes.

## Installation
You need a 64 bit Python 3 installation.

Install Pipenv.

Go to the jambalaya folder and run:

* *pipenv install --dev*
* *pipenv shell*

If you want to run handler.py, install PhantomJS and put it on your PATH, but it probably
doesn't need any more work and the server runs it every day.
