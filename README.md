# jambalaya

## Current Goal

Tell us the historically optimal time to buy a ticket.

## Installation
You need a 64 bit Python 3 installation.

Install Pipenv.

Go to the jambalaya folder and run:

* *pipenv install --dev*
* *pipenv shell*

If you want to run handler.py, install PhantomJS and put it on your PATH, but it probably
doesn't need any more work and the server runs it so we don't need to run it locally.
